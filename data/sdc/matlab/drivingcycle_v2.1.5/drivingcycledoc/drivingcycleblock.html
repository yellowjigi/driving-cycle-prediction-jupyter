        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            These blocks produce driving cycle data, as used in many 
            automotive applications.  They output displacement, velocity 
            and acceleration, all in SI units.  The user can choose from a 
            list of popular cycles.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            I created these blocks to help my students and researchers get 
            up and running quickly.  They aren't guaranteed as fit for any 
            particular purpose, but I hope you find them useful.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The internal structure of the continuous time version of the
            block is illustrated below.  (The discrete time version is 
            similar.)

                WLTP class 3.

                This is a checkbox.  If ticked, the simulation will 
                continue until its stop time is reached; if not, it will
                automatically terminate after <strong>two</strong> cycles.

                This is only available on the discrete version of the 
                block. It is specified in seconds and should work exactly
                as expected.
